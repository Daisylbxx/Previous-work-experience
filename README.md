Over the past five years, I have gained extensive experience in the construction industry, specializing in the field of schematic design, mainly involving residential projects. I play multiple roles in teamwork, from the overall floor plan layout and daylight calculation of residential areas, to the optimization of floor plan design and fa√ßade form of single buildings, to post text layout and quick rendering of images to communicate with clients. This gave me an in-depth understanding of the various stages of a project, thus enhancing my overall capabilities.

In the real estate industry, I have met the fast-paced challenges and honed my adaptability and stress resistance. The close teamwork has further cultivated my spirit of cooperation with others. These experiences have convinced me that the power of a team can create outstanding results, and I would like to continue to grow and contribute in such an environment.
